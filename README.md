Lua syntax highlighting for World of Warcraft addons

to select what coloring highlights you want, load the coloring files in order of lowest to highest
as each file loaded will overwrite any duplicate entries done before it.

after the color schemes are selected load indent lua and it will automatically load the colors within itself
